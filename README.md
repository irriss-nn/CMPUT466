## Machine Learning Course: Linear Regression and Classification Problems

This repository contains code and related materials for the machine learning course I am taking. The main focus of this repository is on linear regression and classification problems. The code is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Introduction

This repository covers the following topics:
- **Linear Regression:**
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
- **Classification Problems:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

## Datasets

This repository uses the following datasets for demonstrating the algorithms:

- MNIST Dataset: A large database of handwritten digits, commonly used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
- Balance Scale Dataset: A dataset for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms. The dataset contains 625 instances with 4 attributes, where the goal is to predict the balance scale tip based on the given attributes.
- Boston Housing Dataset: A dataset for studying regression problems, containing information about various houses in Boston. The dataset consists of 506 samples, with 13 features each, and the goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes.
